# ANN-Alpha-NanoML
 This is the Pronet ANN, an easy to use, lightweight machine learning algoritim for microcontrollers. Traditionaly, you would install a heavy machine learning module that is around 0.5 GB ( Tensorflow ), and they only run on a CPU. But now you can take a module that is only a few Kilobytes, and run it on microcontrollers as well!
